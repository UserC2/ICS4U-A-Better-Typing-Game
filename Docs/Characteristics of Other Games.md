## Good Characteristics of Other Games
* Variety of games makes it more engaging
* Take user through 1 key at a time before typing words out
* Keyboard shortcuts for navigation = user can spend more time typing
  * Enter key to advance instead of clicking is much easier
* Branch-hopping game is entertaining
* Option for error correction:
  * Require backspace (i.e. with "rrr" typing "rrf‚Üêr" is valid)
  * Reject invalid character (i.e. with "rrr" typing "rrfr" is valid)
* Only displaying the current target pattern or the next and current target patterns makes looking down at the keyboard much more difficult (especially if the patterns are short) since you won't know what to type without looking at the screen
* Do not present full pattern to user (only in parts) or user will just look at keyboard after reading it once
  * Bonus: Gives user sense of accomplishment once they complete the part of the pattern
* Quick + responsive performance is useful: User doesn't want to wait on a loading screen (don't waste the user's time)
* Option for case-sensitivity:
  * Disabled
  * Enabled, include warning when Caps Lock is on (and target only includes lowercase)
* "Daily Goal" counter for amount of *time spent typing* (not just playing) is useful to encourage the user to use the program for longer
* Minor sound effects make game a little nicer to play
  * Background music can sometimes help (setting to turn it off is useful if user's computer doesn't have easily adjustable volume)
* Errors made should be clearly indicated
* Reward user for progress in an obvious fashion (e.g. bar on top of the screen)
* Short lesson duration (e.g. 1 minute) is useful for keeping the user happy (more frequent rewards = happier)
* Punish the user for incorrect typing habits by using inconvenient combinations of words during a typing tests (e.g. if the user likes to use the same finger on one hand for every key, make the pattern use keys that are far apart on the keyboard so their score will be terrible unless they type properly)
* Enforcing a time limit on a game or later lesson is useful (e.g. branch snapping if user takes too long to type a word).
  * Useful AFTER they learn basic keys, or they will learn a sketchily inaccurate but fast style of typing.
* Instant and obvious feedback enhances the user experience (most rhythm games do this, it's very clear when you mess up a note)
  * If it isn't clear when the user makes an error, it will cause confusion instead of teaching them
* Statistics over time (e.g. high score for each lesson) helps show the user's improvement over time
* If you make the user type too fast, they'll throw away what you're trying to teach them and use a more questionable style instead, especially if they have previous experience typing incorrectly

### Scoring
